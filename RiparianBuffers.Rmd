Overview
RiparianBuffers is a SpaDES module that computes a fractional riparian influence raster (values between 0 and 1) from hydrological stream geometry and buffer-distance rules.

The module is policy-aware but decision-free.
It generates a spatial signal only.

Purpose
Riparian effects are often implemented as binary exclusions or embedded in landbase logic.
This module separates signal generation from decision-making.

What the module does
Computes fractional riparian influence (0–1)

Supports uniform or province-based buffer distances

Preserves sub-cell riparian structure

Produces reusable outputs for downstream modules

What the module does not do
Define landbase or effective harvestable area

Apply harvest or regulatory exclusions

Classify forest / non-forest land

Interpret policy or management rules

Inputs
Input object	Class	Description
PlanningRaster	SpatRaster	Target planning grid
Hydrology_streams	SpatVector	Stream / river network
Provinces	SpatVector	Jurisdiction boundaries
Buffer policy
A single buffering strategy is used per run.

data.frame(
  province_code = c("ON", "QC", "NB"),
  buffer_m      = c(300, 300, 300)
)
Buffer distances are applied geometrically only.

Outputs
sim$Riparian
Element	Description
riparianFraction	Fractional riparian influence (0–1)
raster_m	Resolution used for computation
policy	Buffer policy applied
Interpretation
0 → no riparian influence

1 → fully riparian

intermediate values → partial influence

Downstream modules decide how this signal is used.

Summary
RiparianBuffers produces a transparent and reusable spatial signal representing riparian influence, without embedding landbase or management assumptions.
