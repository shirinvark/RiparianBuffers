## Overview

This module translates hydrological stream geometry into a continuous spatial
signal representing riparian influence.

The module is intentionally **policy-aware but decision-neutral**.

---

## Design philosophy

Riparian influence is treated as a physical signal rather than a binary constraint.

This design allows:
- comparison across jurisdictions
- sensitivity analysis
- deferred interpretation in downstream modules

---

## Province-based riparian policy

Jurisdictional differences in riparian regulations are expressed
as a simple policy table with the following fields:

- `province_code`
- `buffer_m`

This approach avoids embedding policy logic directly into hydrological processing
and enables transparent modification or scenario testing.

---

## Outputs

The primary output is a raster expressing proportional riparian influence,
which can be interpreted differently depending on downstream use cases.

---

## Future directions

- Integration with landbase accounting modules
- Scenario-based riparian policy testing
- Evaluation of ecological versus regulatory buffer widths
